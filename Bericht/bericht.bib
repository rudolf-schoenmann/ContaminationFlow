	abstract = {With the advancements of materials science and technology, organic materials found significant applications in aerospace industry. But under the orbital thermal and vacuum environment, organic materials can outgas and the outgassed products and induced environment often degraded performances of spacecraft or its subsystem. In this article, the typical impacts of outgassing environment on spacecraft are explained briefly. Then the outgassing theory, test method, identification of compounds and control measures were reviewed in detail. The need for transient and long-term outgassing model is discussed. The standard test methods of E595 and E1559 are compared. The promising new techniques such as infrared spectrometry and/or mass-spectrometry with thermogravimetric analysis is proposed for the identification of outgassed compounds. The vacuum bakeout and molecular absorber for outgassing control are reviewed and for the last more research work is needed.}

abstract = {Summary The Euler method, in its simplicity, can be adapted to give good numerical approximations to a wide range of problems. Furthermore, it is possible to provide a reliable theory for the behaviour of the closely related implicit Euler method, as well as the Euler method itself. This chapter considers generalizations of the Euler Method, which will yield improved numerical behaviour but will retain its characteristic property of simplicity. The idea of extending the Euler method by allowing the approximate solution at a point to depend on the solution values and the derivative values at several previous step values is now known as the Adams-Bashforth method. Many differential equation solvers have been constructed, based on a variety of computational schemes, from Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods to Taylor series and extrapolation methods. One can equip an Almost Runge-Kutta method with local error estimation, variable stepsize and interpolation.}
